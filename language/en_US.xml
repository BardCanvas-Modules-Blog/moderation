                It is possible to set an expiration for a word of prhase by using the next syntax:<br>
                <code>word or phrase | start_date | days</code><br>
                Example:<br>
                <code>the president sucks | 2016-12-01 | 31</code><br>
                In that sample, the phrase <code>the president sucks</code> will get checked
                for 31 d√≠as starting December 12 of 2016.<br>
                Note: the check will remain until the end of the last day (23:59:59).<br><br>
